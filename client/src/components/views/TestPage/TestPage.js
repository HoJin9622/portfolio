        <p>
          At Success by Design, we understand how important it is for educators
          to find the right tools for student success. When it comes to buying
          materials in bulk, teachers and campus administrators feel the weight
          of that responsibility twice over. No one wants to spend their limited
          resources on a product their students are just going to set aside.
